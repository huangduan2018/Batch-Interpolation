name=Batch Interpolation
qgisMinimumVersion=2.0
description=A QGIS-plugin, which creates a batch process of the QGIS Raster Interpolation (TIN or IDW) and gdal_contour.
version=1.0.0
author=Christoph Jung
email=jagodki.cj@gmail.com

about=With this plugin the user can start a batch of interpolations using different attributes of the same point layer. Creating contour lines of the interpolated raster files as a batch process is possible too. The plugin uses the QGIS-functions for IDW- and TIN-interpolation and gdal_contour for creating contour lines. Please note, that the first layer in the table of content has to be a vector layer, otherwise the plugin will crash. Further information about the usage can be found on the GitHub-page.
